# HelloPhoenix

Example project using Phoenix 1.8 and LiveToast

To start your Phoenix server:
* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

## Main Questions:

Why `LiveToast.send_toast` doesn't work at all?

On push_patch or push_navigate it always uses `flash` instead of `toast` is it correct?
